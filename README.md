# optimisers-pypi-dev

My attempt to develop a pypi package for Machine Learning during my masters. Package splices dataset randomly and showcases which optimisers shows the best result when you train your model on a dataset.
This is a hybrid attempt to easily optimise the optimiser selection process. You see what I did there, optimise-optimiser INCEPTION.
