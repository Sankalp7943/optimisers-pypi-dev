# optimisers-pypi-dev

My attempt to develop a pypi package for Machine Learning during my masters. Package splices dataset randomly and showcases which optimisers shows the best result when you train your model on a dataset.
This is a hybrid attempt to easily optimise the optimiser selection process. You see what I did there, optimise-optimiser INCEPTION.

After analyzing the performance of different optimisers, create a hybrid configuration for optimisers for better model training.

Project is currently at Pypi server and can be installed using 'pip install -U mliiitl'
